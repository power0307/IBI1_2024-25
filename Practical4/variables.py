# 4.1 Some simple math
a = 15 # walk to bus station
b = 75 # bus runing time
c = a + b # totle time of bus
d = 90 # car running time
e = 5 # walk from the park
f = d + e # totle time of car
if c > f: # compare the totle times
    print ("car is faster")
else:
    print ("bus is faster")
# result: bus is quicker

# 4.2 Booleans
X = True
Y = False
W = X and Y 
print (W) 
# False
