Queustion:
How does the variance value for the UK compare to that of France? 
What does this comparison imply about the variability of "DALYs" data between these two countries?

Line:
26,27,28,29,30,31

Discussion:
It would mean that the "DALYs" data in France shows more variability.
This might be due to unique health challenges, social or economic factors in France that cause more inconsistent "DALYs" measurements.
